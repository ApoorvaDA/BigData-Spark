## Project title : "People You Might Know" - Friend recommendation for algorithm for Social Media

In this assignment, we have used Apache Spark/Scala to analyze Social Network Data.
The key idea is, if two people have a lot of mutual friends, then the program should 
recommend they connect with each other. 

The input file soc-LiveJournal2Adj.txt contains an adjacent list of multiple lines in
the following format:
<User><TAB><List of friends>
